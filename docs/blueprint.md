## Style Guidelines:

- Dark gradient background to create a sleek, modern feel. The analogous colors give off a professional look. Primary color: A vibrant green (#98FF98) to accent core elements, calling attention to them without clashing.
- Background color: A very dark desaturated green (#1A1A1A), providing a dark scheme while still being the same hue as the primary color.
- Accent color: A light blue (#98D8FF) to complement the primary green, differentiating CTAs and highlights without losing unity. A more saturated, lighter analog of the primary, this contrasts with the dark scheme and the green highlights, without using teal.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface with a neutral look; its clean aesthetic complements the TikTok-style interface.
- TikTok-style layout with full-screen video playback, overlay UI elements, and bottom navigation.
- Simple, clean icons for navigation and interactive elements. For the main action 'Zipp', consider a custom, branded icon (a stylized 'Z').
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations for a fluid user experience when recording or switching between tabs.
